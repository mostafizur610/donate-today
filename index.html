            <p>Seeing the suffering of the flood victims, it seemed that they could not sleep at night. Beautiful tidy
                <br>
                houses are now floating in the water. Everything has been washed away in the flood waters. <br> Ordinary
                people working as day laborers are in dire straits. Heavy rains have disrupted <br> public life in
                brtowns
                and
                villages. Millions of people get <br> lost in the thought of giving two handfuls of food to their
                children. <br>
                May Allah protect their lives and property. <br> Help those who need more....
